PORT=7000                        # Server port

# Public URL (optional)
# If set, this will be used for QR code generation instead of auto-detection

# Security
SESSION_SECRET=change-this-secret-in-production
APP_PASSWORD=photobooth2024      # Password for accessing the app

# Development Notes:

# - In production (npm start): Uses HTTP, expects reverse proxy to handle HTTPS
# - PUBLIC_URL is optional - the app will auto-detect the domain from request headers
